|Rule|Description|
|:--|:--|
|[**S**ingle responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)|A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.|
|[**O**pen/closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)|A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification.|
|[**L**iskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)|It should be possible to substitute base class with derived class.|
|[**I**nterface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)|Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.|
|[**D**ependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)|Depend upon Abstractions but not on concretions. This means that each module should be separated from other using an abstract layer which binds them together. Source code dependency points in the opposite direction compared to the flow of control.|

Two accesses to (reads of or writes to) the same variable are said to be conflicting if at least one of the accesses is a write.

* *Data race*. When an evaluation of an expression writes to a memory location and another evaluation reads or modifies the same memory location, the expressions are said to conflict. A program that has two conflicting evaluations has a data race unless
  * both evaluations execute on the same thread or in the same signal handler, or
  * both conflicting evaluations are atomic operations (see std::atomic), or
  * one of the conflicting evaluations happens-before another (see std::memory_order)

  If a data race occurs, the behavior of the program is undefined.
